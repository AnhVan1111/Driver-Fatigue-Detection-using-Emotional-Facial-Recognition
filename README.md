# Driver-Fatigue-Detection-using-Emotional-Facial-Recognition


Designed and developed a Driver Fatigue Prediction System using emotional facial recognition.
(represented by system architecture diagram, sequence diagram, etc.)
Utilized MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection and feature extraction.
Applied ResNet-18 for feature encoding and LSTM/RNN models for temporal sequence learning
to predict fatigue states.
Built a real-time web-based deployment platform using Flask and Python.
Enabled continuous monitoring of driversâ€™ facial states and automatic classification into normal,
distracted, or drowsy conditions.
Achieved 98% accuracy under standard lighting conditions with efficient inference performance.
